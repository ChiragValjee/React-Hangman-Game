Hangman is a guessing game where one player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers one at a time. The game is won if the guessing player can guess the word before they run out of guesses, which typically involve drawing a stick figure as the "hanged man".

How to Play
1) When you open the game, you will see a blank space for each letter of the word you need to guess.

2) Click on the letters to make a guess. If the letter is in the word, it will appear in its correct position(s). If the letter is not in the word, a part of the "hanged man" will be drawn.

3) You have a limited number of guesses, so use them wisely. If you guess the word correctly before the "hanged man" is fully drawn, you win. Otherwise, you lose.

4) After the game is over, you can choose to play again by clicking the "Play Again" button.

That's it! Have fun playing Hangman.
